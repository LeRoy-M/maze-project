MAZE PROJECT 🎮
===============
_**Feels like the 90's**_

Overview
--------
This project is a trial at game programming, using the **C** programming language and the **SDL** library. It makes use of a method known as `raycasting` to be able to draw the 2D objects as 3D projections of themselves, such as lines as vertical walls. Hope you enjoy!
